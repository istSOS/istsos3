Feature of Interest
===================



.. note::

    Related features are NOT necessarily features of interest (and associated
    with observations). The listing of a related feature can be used for
    discovery purposes by the service provider. The related feature can for
    example be the Gulf of Mexico in case an SOS serves data measured by
    sensors that are carried by marine drifters in the Gulf of Mexico area.
    Especially in such cases of mobile sensors, it is not reasonable to list
    all features of interest (= the sampling locations) as related features,
    since the Capabilities document would grow too big over time [OGC 12-006].
